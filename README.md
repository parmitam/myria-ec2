Myria-EC2 is a tool that allows you to automatically deploy Myria to a cluster through the Amazon EC2 service. To do this, you must have an [Amazon EC2 account](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). You will also need the Myria-EC2 project, which is found under the Myria-Stack. Alternatively, you can directly clone the Myria-EC2 repository.

See our [detailed documentation](http://myria.cs.washington.edu/docs/myria-ec2.html) for additional information on using this module.
